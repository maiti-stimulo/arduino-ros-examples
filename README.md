# arduino-ros-examples
Set of examples of to learn the interface between ROS and Arduino

## Dependecies
To run the examples you need both the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) and [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu), as well as two extra packages not shipped with the ROS Desktop-full installation:
```shell 
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino
```
```shell 
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial-python
```
*Note: Examples also run correctly with ROS Indigo*

## Setting Up
The first time you need to call a python script that will generate the necessary code for the Arduino. 
$ cd your-arduino-sketchbook/libraries
$ rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .

*Note: In case you later generate (and install!) a new custom ROS message, or you install a new package with new messages, you will need to run again this script.

## Running
1. Complie and Load The Arduino code to your board with the Arduino IDE
2. Execute the launch file: 
```shell 
$ roslaunch arduino_ros_examples oscillator.launch
```
